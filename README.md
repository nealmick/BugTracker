# SquashBug

A ticket system to help you track, collaborate,  and destroy bugs.


The ticket system was built with Django utilizing a MVC design architecture. The system enables collaboration by allowing many accounts to work together on each ticket. All tickets have a severity rating, date, author, as well as comments and attached files. The ticket dashboard enables sorting, pagination, and stats with ticket distribution graphs. New tickets are created with a form and can be edited. The project also includes an admin dashboard, and is mobile responsive.
