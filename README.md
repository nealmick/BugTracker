# SquashBug
A ticket system to help you track, collaborate,  and destroy bugs.

The web app was built with the Django Python library using a MVC design architecture.  The app includes users creation, login, password reset, and logout.  Each user has a profile which keeps information such as, profile pictures, amount of tickets, and completed tickets.  The main view is ordered by date and paginated by a list of the users tickets.  The ticket list view also contains graphs displaying distrubutions categorically.  Each ticket model contains a severity rating, title, description, date created, foreign users, and completed values.  Each ticket also contains comments, and files.  new tickets can be submited using a form.
